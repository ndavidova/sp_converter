1 General
1.1 Overview
This document is the non-proprietary FIPS 140-3 Security Policy for version 5.14.0-
70.53.1.el9_0; libkcapi 1.3.1-3.el9 of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Kernel Cryptographic
API module. It contains the security rules under which the module must operate and
describes how this module meets the requirements as specified in FIPS PUB 140-3 (Federal
Information Processing Standards Publication 140-3) for an overall Security Level 1 module.
This Non-Proprietary Security Policy may be reproduced and distributed, but only whole and
intact and including this notice. Other documentation is proprietary to their authors.
1.1.1 How this Security Policy was prepared
In preparing the Security Policy document, the laboratory formatted the vendor-supplied
documentation for consolidation without altering the technical statements therein contained.
The further refining of the Security Policy document was conducted iteratively throughout
the conformance testing, wherein the Security Policy was submitted to the vendor, who
would then edit, modify, and add technical contents. The vendor would also supply
additional documentation, which the laboratory formatted into the existing Security Policy,
and resubmitted to the vendor for their final editing.

2 Cryptographic Module Specification
2.1 Description
Purpose and Use:
The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Kernel Cryptographic API (hereafter referred to as “the
module”) provides a C language application program interface (API) for use by other (kernel
space and user space) processes that require cryptographic functionality. The module
operates on a general-purpose computer as part of the Linux kernel. Its cryptographic
functionality can be accessed using the Linux Kernel Crypto API.
Module Type: Software
Module Embodiment: MultiChipStand
Module Characteristics:
Cryptographic Boundary:
The cryptographic boundary of the module is defined as the kernel binary and the kernel
crypto object files, the libkcapi library, and the sha512hmac binary, which is used to verify
the integrity of the software components. In addition, the cryptographic boundary contains
the .hmac files which store the expected integrity values for each of the software
components.
Tested Operational Environment’s Physical Perimeter (TOEPP) [O]:
The TOEPP of the module is defined as the general-purpose computer on which the module
is installed.

Table 8: Security Function Implementations
2.7 Algorithm Specific Information
Legacy use:
Digital Signature Verification with SHA-1 is allowed for legacy use only.
2.7.1 AES GCM IV
The Crypto Officer shall consider the following requirements and restrictions when using the
module.
© 2024 Red Hat, Inc./ atsec information security corporation.
This document can be reproduced and distributed only whole and intact, including this copyright notice.
Page 29 of 103
For IPsec, the module offers the AES GCM implementation and uses the context of Scenario
1 of FIPS 140-3 IG C.H. The mechanism for IV generation is compliant with RFC 4106. IVs
generated using this mechanism may only be used in the context of AES GCM encryption
within the IPsec protocol.
The module does not implement IPsec. The module’s implementation of AES GCM is used
together with an application that runs outside the module’s cryptographic boundary. This
application must use RFC 7296 compliant IKEv2 to establish the shared secret SKEYSEED
from which the AES GCM encryption keys are derived.
The design of the IPsec protocol implicitly ensures that the counter (the nonce_explicit part
of the IV) does not exhaust the maximum number of possible values for a given session key.
In the event the module’s power is lost and restored, the consuming application must ensure
that a new key for use with the AES GCM key encryption or decryption under this scenario
shall be established.
The module also provides a non-approved AES GCM encryption service which accepts
arbitrary external IVs from the operator. This service can be requested by invoking the
crypto_aead_encrypt API function with an AES GCM handle. When this is the case, the API
will not set an approved service indicator, as described in section 4.3.
2.7.2 AES XTS
The length of a single data unit encrypted or decrypted with AES XTS shall not exceed 220
AES blocks, that is 16MB, of data per XTS instance. An XTS instance is defined in Section 4 of
SP 800-38E. To meet the requirement stated in IG C.I, the module implements a check to
ensure that the two AES keys used in AES XTS mode are not identical.
The XTS mode shall only be used for the cryptographic protection of data on storage
devices. It shall not be used for other purposes, such as the encryption of data in transit.
2.7.3 RSA
For RSA signature verification, the module supports modulus size 3072 and 4096 bits. The
supported modulus size has been CAVP tested in compliance in IG C.F.
2.7.4 SHA-3
The module provides SHA-3 hash functions compliant with IG C.C. Every implementation of
each SHA-3 function was tested and validated on all the module’s operating environments.
SHAKE functions are not implemented. SHA-3 hash functions are also used as part of a
higher-level algorithm for HMAC.

Table 10: Entropy Sources
The module implements three different Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG)
implementations based on SP 800-90Ar1: CTR_DRBG, Hash_DRBG, and HMAC_DRBG. Each of
these DRBG implementations can be instantiated by the operator of the module. When
instantiated, these DRBGs can be used to generate random numbers for external usage.
Additionally, the module employs a specific HMAC-SHA2-512 DRBG implementation for
internal purposes (e.g. to generate initialization vectors). This DRBG is initially seeded with
384 output bits from the entropy source (357 bits of entropy) and reseeded with 256 output
bits from the entropy source (238 bits of entropy).
2.9 Key Generation
The module does not provide key generation.
2.10 Key Establishment
As permitted by IG D.G, the module provides key transport methods by using AES-GCM
encryption mode in the context of IPsec protocol.
2.11 Industry Protocols
AES GCM with internal IV generation in the approved mode is compliant with RFC 4106 and
shall only be used in conjunction with the IPsec protocol. No parts of this protocol, other than
the AES GCM implementation, have been tested by the CAVP and CMVP.

5 Software/Firmware Security
5.1 Integrity Techniques
The Linux kernel binary is integrity tested using an HMAC-SHA2-512 calculation performed
by the sha512hmac utility (which utilizes the module’s HMAC and SHA-512
implementations). An HMAC-SHA2-512 calculation is also performed on the sha512hmac
utility and the libkcapi library to verify their integrity. The kernel crypto object files listed in
section 2.2 are loaded on start-up by the module and verified using RSA signature
verification with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, SHA-256, and a 3072-bit key.
5.2 Initiate on Demand
Integrity tests are performed as part of the pre-operational self-tests, which are executed
when the module is initialized. The integrity tests can be invoked on demand by unloading
and subsequently re-initializing the module, which will perform (among others) the software
integrity tests.
5.3 Open-Source Parameters [O]

6 Operational Environment
6.1 Operational Environment Type and Requirements
Type of Operational Environment: Modifiable
How Requirements are Satisfied [O]:
The operating system provides process isolation and memory protection mechanisms that
ensure appropriate separation for memory access among the processes on the system. Each
process has control over its own data and uncontrolled access to the data of other processes
is prevented.
6.2 Configuration Settings and Restrictions [O]
The module shall be installed as stated in Section 11.1.
Instrumentation tools like the ptrace system call, gdb and strace, as well as other tracing
mechanisms offered by the Linux environment such as ftrace or systemtap, shall not be
used in the operational environments. The use of any of these tools implies that the
cryptographic module is running in a non-validated operational environment.
6.3 Additional Information [O]
The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system is used as the basis of other products which
include but are not limited to:
• Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS
• Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
• Red Hat OpenStack Platform
• Red Hat OpenShift
• Red Hat Gluster Storage
• Red Hat Satellite

Table 22: Pre-Operational Self-Tests
The pre-operational software integrity tests are performed automatically when the module is
powered on, before the module transitions into the operational state. The algorithms used
for the integrity test (i.e., HMAC-SHA2-512 and RSA SigVer with 3072 bit key) run their
CASTs before the integrity test is performed. While the module is executing the self-tests,
services are not available, and data output (via the data output interface) is inhibited until
the pre-operational software integrity self-tests are successfully completed. The module
transitions to the operational state only after the pre-operational self-tests are passed
successfully.

Table 23: Conditional Self-Tests
The module performs self-tests on all approved cryptographic algorithms as part of the
approved services supported in the approved mode of operation, using the tests shown in
the table above. Services are not available, and data output (via the data output interface) is
inhibited during the conditional self-tests. If any of these tests fails, the module transitions
to the Error State.

11 Life-Cycle Assurance
11.1 Installation, Initialization, and Startup Procedures
The module is distributed as a part of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL 9) package in
the form of the kernel-5.14.0-70.53.1.el9_0, libkcapi-1.3.1-3.el9, and libkcapi-hmaccalc-
1.3.1-3.el9 RPM packages.
The module can achieve the approved mode by:
• For installation add the fips=1 option to the kernel command line during the system
installation. During the software selection stage, do not install any third-party
software. More information can be found at the vendor documentation.
• Switching the system into the approved mode the installation. Execute the fips-
mode-setup --enable command. Restart the system. More information can be found
at the vendor documentation.
In both cases, the Crypto Officer must verify the RHEL 9 system operates in the approved
mode by executing the “fips-mode-setup --check” command, which should output “FIPS
mode is enabled.”
11.2 Administrator Guidance
After installation of the kernel-5.14.0-70.53.1.el9_0, libkcapi-1.3.1-3.el9, and libkcapi-
hmaccalc-1.3.1-3.el9 RPM packages, the Crypto Officer must execute the “cat
/proc/sys/crypto/fips_name” command. The Crypto Officer must ensure that the proper
name is listed in the output as follows:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 - Kernel Cryptographic API
Then, the Crypto Officer must execute the “cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_version” and “rpm -q
libkcapi” commands. These commands must output the following (one line per output):
5.14.0-70.53.1.el9_0.x86_64
libkcapi-1.3.1-3.el9.x86_64
11.3 Non-Administrator Guidance
There is no non-administrator guidance.
11.4 Design and Rules [O]
Not applicable for this module.
11.5 Maintenance Requirements [O]
There are no maintenance requirements.
11.6 End of Life [O]

As the module does not persistently store SSPs, secure sanitization of the module consists of
unloading the module. This will zeroize all SSPs in volatile memory. Then, if desired, the
kernel-5.14.0-70.53.1.el9_0, libkcapi-1.3.1-3.el9, and libkcapi-hmaccalc-1.3.1-3.el9 RPM
packages can be uninstalled from the RHEL 9 system.
