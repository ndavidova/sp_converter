2.6 Overall Security Design
1. The Module provides two distinct operator roles: User (User Application external entity) and
Cryptographic Officer (Manager).
2. The Module provides identity-based authentication.
3. The Module clears previous authentications on power cycle.
4. An operator does not have access to any cryptographic services prior to assuming an authorized role.
5. The Module allows the operator to initiate power-up self-tests by power cycling power or resetting
the Module.
6. Pre-Operational self-tests do not require any operator action.
7. Data output are inhibited during key generation, self-tests, zeroization, and error states.
8. Status information does not contain CSPs or sensitive data that if misused could lead to a compromise
of the Module.
9. There are restrictions on which SSPs are zeroized by the zeroization service. Factory reset will zeroize
all SSPs of the module, tamper detection or EFP failure will zeroize all unprotected SSPs of the module.
10. The Module does not support concurrent operators.
11. The Module does not support a maintenance interface or role.
12. The Module does not support manual SSP establishment method.
13. The Module does not have any proprietary external input/output devices used for entry/output of
data.

4 Roles, Services and Authentication
4.1 Assumption of Roles and Related Services
The Module supports two distinct operator roles, User (User Application external entity) and
Cryptographic Officer (CO) (Manager). The cryptographic module enforces the separation of roles using
identity-based authentication. Re-authentication is enforced when changing roles. If the CO logs in while
the user is logged in, the user will be automatically logged out.
Table 12 lists all operator roles supported by the Module and their related services. In addition, the
Module supports services which does not require to be authenticated, listed UA in Table 12.
The Module does not support a maintenance role and bypass capability. The Module does not support
concurrent operators. Previous authentications will be cleared on power cycle. The physical security
mechanisms employed by the module protect the SSPs from unauthorized disclosure, modification, and
substitution via physical intrusions.

4.2 Authentication Methods
The module uses identity-based authentication to identify and verify users of the module. For roles as the
manager are identified by UKEY_ID and verified using a challenge-response mechanism based on a 2048-
bit RSA key pair, and user are identified by username and verified using a challenge-response mechanism
based on sha2-256. The public key is stored in the module in plaintext, and the private key is stored in the
user’s USB token.
The module ensures that there is no visible display of the authentication data.
Table 13 – Authentication Description
Role Authentication Method Authentication Strength
CO Identity-based - The CO is authenticated by
UKEY_ID and verified using challenge-
response mechanism based on a 2048-bit
RSA key pair.
The public key is stored in the module in
plaintext, and the private key is stored in the
user’s USB token.
112 bits strength of the authentication method,
the probability of a successful random attempt is
1 in 2112
Each RSA Signature Verification authentication
attempt takes at least 60ms. So, the number of
attempts for one minute cannot exceed 1000.
The USB token corresponding to CO allows six (6)
consecutive failed attempts before locking. After
a successful attempt, the number of failures will
be reset to zero. After six (6) consecutive failed
attempts, the USB token cannot be used.
User Identity-based – The User role sends assigned
username to HSM, and HSM utilizes a
challenge-response mechanism for user role
authentication. The user's password is
protected with a cryptographic hash (SHA-
256 message digest).
Since the password length is eight (8) ASCII
printable characters and there are 95 ASCII
printable characters, the probability of a
successful random attempt is 1 in
{(10)*(26^2)*(95^5)} (at least one number, one
uppercase, one lowercase).
1. HSM waits for the user to log in.
2. When the user enters the wrong PIN code for
the first time, HSM sets the number of
consecutive PIN code errors to 1 and starts the
consecutive PIN code error cycle timing.
3. Within the consecutive PIN code error cycle
(24 hours), if the user enters the wrong PIN code
6 times, the HSM will be locked for 60 minutes.
4. After 60 minutes, HSM will clear the number
of consecutive PIN code errors, and the
consecutive PIN code error cycle will end and be
cleared.
5. Loop back to step 1 and provide login service
to the user again.

5 Software/Firmware Security
The Module is a Level 3 multi-chip standalone hardware module.
Firmware integrity verification uses an approved digital signature cryptographic mechanism, if the
calculated result is not successfully verified, the test fails, and the module enters the error state.
In the production process, the public key of the firmware integrity key pair is written into the flash of the
AS578 in plaintext. Use the sha256 algorithm to calculate the message digest of the bootloader, kernel,
and application of the IMX6 and the message digest of the executable code of the AS578, sign these
message digests with the private key of the firmware integrity key pair, and write these signatures into
the flash of the AS578. The firmware integrity check of IMX6 and AS578 is performed as follows:
AS578:
• Read the digital signature of executable code message digest stored in the flash of AS578, verify the
signature with the public key of the firmware integrity key pair, and get the message digest.
• Read executable code and use sha256 algorithm to calculate message digest.
• Compare the two message digests, if the digests are consistent, the firmware integrity check will
pass, otherwise module enters the error state.
imx6:
• Read the images of bootloader, kernel and application on EMMC respectively, use sha256 algorithm
to calculate the message digest, and transfer the message digest to AS578.
• Read the digital signature of bootloader, kernel, and application stored in the flash of AS578, verify
the signature with the public key of the firmware integrity key pair, and obtain the message digest.
• Compare the two message digests, if the digests are consistent, the firmware integrity check will
pass, otherwise module enters the error state.
The operator can initiate the integrity test on demand by rebooting the module.

6 Operational Environment
The Module has a non-modifiable operational environment under the FIPS 140-3 definitions. The tested
operational environment is listed in Table 2.
The Module does not include a firmware load service to support necessary updates. Any firmware not
identified in this Security Policy does not constitute the Module defined by this Security Policy or covered
by this validation.

7 Physical Security
The module is a multiple-chip standalone cryptographic module. Physical security is designed according
to Level 3 standards.
7.1 Tamper-Evident Seals
The cryptographic module is contained within a strong enclosure with four (4) tamper-evident seals on
the top, left side and bottom and right side and bottom as described in Table 17. Each tamper evident seal
is individually identifiable. The cryptographic module will perform EFP. If the voltage falls outside the
normal operating range of the module, the module will shut down immediately. The Voltage range is 68V-
280V. If the temperature falls outside the normal operating range of the module, the module will
immediately zeroizes all unprotected SSPS. The temperature range is -2℃---46℃.
Table 16 – Physical Security Inspection Guidelines
Physical Security
Mechanism
Recommended Frequency of
Inspection/Test
Inspection/Test Guidance Details
Tamper-Evident Seals Inspect tamper-evident seals
monthly.
Look for signs of tampering. If tampering is
suspected, then the module must be
removed from service.
The Module will be shipped from the manufacturer with tamper-evident seals pre-installed. To operate
the Module in an Approved mode of operation, the CO role shall inspect the tamper-evident seals
IB6127370XXX as shown in Figure 10 to Figure 13 on the reception of the Module. Detailed information
is provided in Table 17.
If the CO determines that the seals were tampered with, the module is to be removed from service and
no longer allowed to be used and is not to be returned to the vendor. The CO will perform the factory
reset to zeroize all SSPs.

7.2 Tamper Detection
The cryptographic module includes a tamper detection feature that will immediately zeroize all SSPs when
the module's cover is removed. This forces a factory reset and will put the module into the Invasive Error
State. This will also close all external interfaces and stop providing all services.
The tamper detection remains active at all times including when the module is powered off, which at that
point, will operate with an internal battery.
As the tamper-evident seals will need to be broken to remove the cover, there is no recovery from the
error state as the module will no longer be in service.
7.3 Environmental Failure Protection (EFP)
The cryptographic module includes Environmental Failure Protection (EFP). If the voltage falls outside the
normal operating range of the module, the module will shut down immediately.
If the temperature falls outside the normal operating range of the module, the module will immediately
zeroizes all unprotected SSPS.

10 Self-Tests
The Module performs self-tests to ensure the proper operation of the Module. Per FIPS 140-3 these are
categorized as either pre-operational self-tests or conditional self-tests.
Pre-operational self–tests are periodically performed by the Module every 720 hours automatically after
the module is powered on, without external input or control. The Module will not accept any commands
when a periodic self-test is required; the commands still in the I/O buffer will be processed by The Module
and the periodic self-test executed when the I/O buffer is emptied. The Module logs self-test errors in the
system log, the CO can consult the error log by View system logs on management software.
When HSM powers on, the operator can perform the on-demand self-test through power cycling.
The self-tests error states and status indicator are described in table below:
Table 22 – Self-Test Error States and Indicators
Error State Description Indicator
ES1 The Module fails a KAT, PCT or firmware integrity pre-
operational self-test.
When HSM enters ES1, the input and output are all closed,
and the only operation to recovery from error state is to
switch power button to restart HSM. After restart, the
HSM performs self-test, that will determine which state
HSM will enter. If HSM enters error state again, the CO
must send the HSM to vendor.
The Module enters the critical error
state and outputs status of the red
LED stays on, the blue LED flashes
quickly, otherwise it indicates
successful completion by Red LED
flashes quickly, blue LED flashes
normally.
The Module performs the following pre-operational self-tests:

The public key of the firmware integrity key pair is written
into the flash of the AS578 in plaintext. Use the sha256
algorithm to calculate the message digest of the
bootloader, kernel, and application of the IMX6 and the
message digest of the executable code of the AS578, sign
these message digests with the private key of the
firmware integrity key pair, and write these signatures
into the flash of the AS578.
When HSM powers on, after self-test of the entropy
source and algorithm, HSM calculates the digests of
bootloader, kernel and IM6 application, and executable
code of the AS578, then use the public key and the
signatures which have been written in AS578, to verify the
firmware integrity.

11 Life-Cycle Assurance
11.1 Secure Installation, Initialization, Startup and Operation of the Module
The module will be securely delivered to the operators via UPS with tracking codes to ensure there is no
tampering during delivery. Upon receipt of the module, the CO must check that the module's outer
packaging is intact or that the packaging has been opened during transport.
Upon delivery, the operator must initialize the module as follows:
1. The operator must ensure that the initial security configuration of the module is completed in a
restricted environment using a direct cabled serial connection from the management console
(standalone PC).
2. From the management program on the console, the operator must select the COM port by
selecting “Connect” from the menu bar.
3. Next, the operator must create the Manager role (CO) by selecting from the Management
program menu: Device → Add MNG. The operator then must insert the first of 3 USB tokens. A
new PASSWORD (8 characters) will be required and stored on the USB token.
4. Repeat this process twice more with different USB Tokens. When the three Manager roles have
been created, HSM can be initialized.
5. Next, the operator will create DMK for the HSM, and export DMK components to USB tokens.
Select from the Management program menu: Device → Create DMK. With 3 different USB token,
CO must sign in the HSM three (3) times, and store DMK component to each USB token. One DMK
component, one USB token.
6. With one of 3 USB tokens, the operator selects from menu, choose: Device → Set Mode of
Operation, and choose “FIPS Mode”. Once “OK” is selected, the module will reboot and perform
the Pre-Operational and Conditional KAT Self-Tests.
7. Select from menu Tools → Reset HSM, which zeroizes all the SSPs, will remove the module from
the Approved Mode of Operation
11.2 Cryptographic Officer Guidance

Other functions can be selected on the menu of the management software and operated according to the
instructions.
COs is responsible for protecting USB tokens and passwords from theft.
COs must periodically check that the tamper evidence seals are intact and located in the correct position
on the chassis. If evidence of tampering is detected, the module shall be considered non-compliant, and
shall be scrapped.
11.3 User Guidance
The Type-C Port is used to connect the cryptographic module and the communication computer. The
communication computer is connected to the application server via Ethernet.
When CO creates a user account, a default password is generated. The default password is emailed to the
appropriate user. The user must change the password when logging in for the first time. Users can access
the services of the cryptographic module only after their identity authentication is passed. The
cryptographic module provides user applications with services such as user login/logout, data encryption
and decryption, data signature and verification.
Users are responsible for protecting their passwords from theft.
12 Mitigation of Other Attacks
The Module does not implement any mitigation method against other attacks.
