### Todo

- [ ] Install and set up dots.ocr
- [ ] Compare the results to docling
- [ ] Solve the issue of TOC, sometimes it conflicts with chapter mapping, could be removed manually or it could be automated
- [ ] Solve the issue of Hyphen-minus (-, U+002D) VS En dash (–, U+2013) VS Em dash (—, U+2014) as this will probably cause problems
- [ ] Support 3rd level hierarchy when applicable (e.g algorithms)


### In Progress

- [ ] Test chapter_mapper against multiple files

### Done ✓

- [x] Implement chapter_mapper
